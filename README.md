## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration between Azure DevOps and GitHub

### Agenda
- Planning => AzDO (Boards: Kanban, Queries, Dashboards)
- Code Source => GH (Code Source with PR, Code Scanning, Dependabot)
- Build (CI) => AzDO pipeline YAML
- Deploy (CD) => AzDO pipeline Classic (Staging, Manual Approvals, Gates?)
